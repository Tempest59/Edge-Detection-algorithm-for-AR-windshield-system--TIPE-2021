Main files are TIPE-final.py and algoCV.py.

This repository is a project I made with a classmate during preparatory classes. 

It's the software part of a pedestrian detection AR system that superposes outline of the detected pedestrian with its real location to provide a kind of night vision to the driver.
The hardware part consists of optical research in order to project a virtual optical image at infinity so the drive doesn't have to accomodate on the windshield to see the displayed informations properly. 

In algoCV, you can find an optimized version of Canny's edge detection algorithm using OpenCV's library.

In TIPE-final, you can find a handmade version of the same algorithm which is far from optimised so doesn't run properly, but has the proper logic built into it.

Other files are just test files for algorithms implanted in TIPE-final.
